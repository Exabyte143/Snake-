# Snake++

Snake++ rewrite, I might make it work on linux in the future.

# Compiliation
To compile you need [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/), and [VCPKG](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html) installed.
To install the dependencies run `vcpkg "@vcpkg_rt.txt"`
When you've installed both of those programs set **CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE** to the path you've installed VCPKG to.
